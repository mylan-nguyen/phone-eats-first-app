# Phone Eats First App

This flutter app is a collection of recipes for my favourite meals. The app allows me to recreate my past meals and display them in a food diary. The app also integrates OpenAI API to help me generate a recipe based on the ingredients I have on hand.

## Development Setup
Clone the repository and run the following commands:
```
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
